## Application overview
The interface main view is the artist list. 
Choosing an artist brings the user to the album list, which then goes to the tracklist for the album.
Long clicking on a track will add it to the track queue.

## Pebble integration
The pebble integration for the application is currently experimental, but has some unique features. 
It was designed for the original Pebble. 
I'm not sure if it's compatible to the newer models, i haven't worked on the pebble application for a while.

Since i developed it on Cloudpebble, the code is not currently on github. Here is the current binary:
